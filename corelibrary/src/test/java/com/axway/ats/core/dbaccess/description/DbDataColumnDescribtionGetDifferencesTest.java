```markdown
Scenario 1: All Fields Are Different
Details:
  TestName: compareAllFieldsDifferent
  Description: This test checks the getDifferences method when all fields between two DbDataColumnDescribtion objects are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of DbDataColumnDescribtion with all fields set differently.
  Act: Call getDifferences method on the first instance, passing the second instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ArrayList contains entries for all fields showing the differences.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that when all fields are different, each difference is captured in the result list.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the method correctly identifies and reports each field difference, which is crucial for data consistency checks.

Scenario 2: No Field Is Different
Details:
  TestName: compareNoFieldsDifferent
  Description: This test checks the getDifferences method when no fields between two DbDataColumnDescribtion objects are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of DbDataColumnDescribtion with all fields set identically.
  Act: Call getDifferences on the first instance, passing the second instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ArrayList is empty.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that no differences are reported when all fields are identical.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the method can correctly identify when two instances are equivalent, avoiding unnecessary data modification flags.

Scenario 3: Some Fields Are Different
Details:
  TestName: compareSomeFieldsDifferent
  Description: This test checks the getDifferences method when only some fields between two DbDataColumnDescribtion objects are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of DbDataColumnDescribtion where only 'Type' and 'Key' fields are set differently.
  Act: Call getDifferences on the first instance, passing the second instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ArrayList contains entries only for 'Type' and 'Key'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that only the fields that are different are reported in the differences list.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Helps confirm that the method precisely isolates and reports only the actual differences, which is essential for targeted data updates.

Scenario 4: Case Sensitivity in String Comparisons
Details:
  TestName: compareCaseSensitivity
  Description: This test checks if the getDifferences method is sensitive to case differences in string fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of DbDataColumnDescribtion, one with all fields in lowercase and the other in uppercase.
  Act: Call getDifferences on the lowercase instance, passing the uppercase instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ArrayList contains entries for fields that are case-sensitive.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks whether the method considers case differences as actual differences.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the method's behavior aligns with the expected handling of string case sensitivity, which could be critical depending on the application's data handling requirements.

Scenario 5: Null Field Handling
Details:
  TestName: compareWithNullFields
  Description: This test examines how getDifferences handles null values in fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of DbDataColumnDescribtion, one with some fields set to null and the other with corresponding fields having non-null values.
  Act: Call getDifferences on the instance with null fields, passing the non-null instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ArrayList correctly identifies fields with null differences.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the method can handle null values correctly without throwing exceptions and properly identifies differences involving nulls.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for ensuring the robustness of the method in real-world scenarios where data fields may not always be fully populated.
